- [ ] respect topological order when stopping processes on request
- [ ] find configuration file automatically if none is explicitly specified
- [ ] `gopm init` command to initialize a configuration file
- [ ] support individual config file rather than just directory?
- [ ] provide `gopm` package as overlay when reading configuration so users don't need to explicitly vendor it (and risk it getting out of date)
- [ ] rename `gopm` package so the identifier doesn't clash with the `gopm` top level value (or rename that value to something else)
- [ ] set user ID when specified
- [ ] print configuration errors consistently and return them all via gRPC so that a `gopmctl reload` command will see them
- [ ] documentation!
- [ ] add `-a` (`--all`) flag to `gopmctl logs` command to print all the available logs for a process
